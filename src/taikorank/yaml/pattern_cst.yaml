### Scale
## Brief:
# Scaling function for pattern stars.
## Variable:
# x is the sum of all parameters for pattern stars
# y is the pattern star rating

vect_pattern_scale_x3: 1.01
vect_pattern_scale_y3: 1.

### Pattern influence
## Brief:
# Give an influence to a pattern.
## Variable:
# x is in ms, the time between the two objects
# y is the influence

### Pattern frequency
## Brief:
# The more frequent a pattern is the easier it is. Based on pattern
# influence.
## Variable:
# x is in [0, 1], the frequency
# y the pattern difficulty
## Note:
# As there is only one parameter the function is transfered to the 
# scaling.
# As double are used the value is a little above 1: 1.01

### Singletap probability
## Brief:
# Give a probability for singletapping, enabling pattern detection.
## Variable:
# x is in ms
# y is the probability to singletap the object
## Note:
# 1500ms =  20bpm 1/2
#  300ms = 100bpm 1/2
#  250ms = 120bpm 1/2
#  160ms ~ 180bpm 1/2
#  125ms = 240bpm 1/2
#  100ms = 300bpm 1/2

### Parameters coeff
## Brief:
# Enable or disable a parameter of the star rating by modifying its 
# multiplier coefficient.
## Variable:
# Multiplier in [0, 1]
