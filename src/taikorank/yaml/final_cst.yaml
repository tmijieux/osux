### Influence
## Brief:
# When an object is a miss or a good it decreases the difficulty of
# the others object.
## Variable:
# x is in ms,  the time between the two object
# y in [0, 1], the difficulty multiplier (star *= y)
# 0 -> min influence

### Scale
## Brief:
# Scaling function for final stars.
## Variable:
# x is the product of all enabled stars
# y is the final star rating

### Pow
## Brief:
# Enable or disable a parameter of the star rating by modifying its
# power.
## Variable:
# Set 1 to enable, 0 to disable

### Weight
## Brief:
# Function to transform the star rating on each object to a star
# rating on the map. Every object give its stars multiplied by y.
## Variable:
# x is the number of the object sorted by star rating, 0 is the
#   highest star rating
# y in [0, 1], the difficulty multiplier
