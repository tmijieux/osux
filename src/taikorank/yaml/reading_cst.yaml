# Everything is based on resolution with 10 objects on screen (4:3)

### Scale
## Brief:
# Scaling function for reading stars.
## Variable:
# x is the sum of all parameters for reading stars
# y is the reading star rating

vect_reading_scale_x1: 1.
vect_reading_scale_y1: 1.
vect_reading_scale_x2: 3.
vect_reading_scale_y2: 3.

### Interest
## Brief:
# Objects are watched to specific times, this function indicates which
# times are more important.
## Variable:
# x is in ms, the time before the object is out of the "play circle"
# y is the interest given to the object.
## Note:
# Under 10bpma difficulty might be reversed.
#  800ms ~200bpma
# 1600ms ~100bpma

### Seen
## Brief:
# Integrate the interest of the object based on the visible part of
# the object and its time on screen.
## Variable:
# x is in ms * px^2 * interset, the "volume" representing how well it
#   is seen.
# y the seen value

### Parameters coeff
## Brief:
# Enable or disable a parameter of the star rating by modifying its
# multiplier coefficient.
## Variable:
# Multiplier in [0, 1]
