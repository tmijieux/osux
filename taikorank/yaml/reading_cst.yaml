# Everything is based on resolution with 10 objects on screen (4:3)

### Scale
## Brief:
# Scaling function for reading stars.
## Variable:
# x is the sum of all parameters for reading stars
# y is the reading star rating
vect_scale_length: 6
vect_scale_x1: 0.      # don't give much more
vect_scale_y1: 2.6
vect_scale_x2: 1.2e2.  # 600bpma
vect_scale_y2: 2.5
vect_scale_x3: 1.8e2.  # 400bpma
vect_scale_y3: 2.
vect_scale_x4: 3.6e2.  # 200bpma
vect_scale_y4: 1.5
vect_scale_x4: 5.1e2.  # 140bpma
vect_scale_y4: 1.1
vect_scale_x5: 7.2e2.  # 100bpma
vect_scale_y5: 1.
vect_scale_x6: 1e10.   # make sure high enough
vect_scale_y6: 1.

### Interest
## Brief:
# Objects are watched to specific times, this function indicates which
# times are more important.
## Variable:
# x is in ms, the time before the object is out of the "play circle"
# y is the interest given to the object.
vect_interest_length: 4
vect_interest_x1: 0.
vect_interest_y1: 0.
vect_interest_x2: 800.    # ~time for 200bpma
vect_interest_y2: 1.
vect_interest_x3: 1600.   # ~time for 100bpma
vect_interest_y3: 0.
vect_interest_x4: 3600000.
vect_interest_y4: 0.

### Seen 
## Brief:
# Integrate the interest of the object based on the visible part of 
# the object and its time on screen.
## Variable:
# x is in ms * px^2 * interset, the "volume" representing how well it 
#   is seen.
# y the seen value
## Note:
# As there is only one parameter the function is transfered to the 
# scaling.
vect_seen_length: 2
vect_seen_x1: 0.
vect_seen_y1: 0.
vect_seen_x2: 1e10.
vect_seen_y2: 1e10.

### Parameters coeff
## Brief:
# Enable or disable a parameter of the star rating by modifying its 
# multiplier coefficient.
## Variable:
# Multiplier in [0, 1]
star_seen: 1.
